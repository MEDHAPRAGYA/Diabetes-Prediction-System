# Intelligent-Diabetes-Prediction
Having this as our minor project, we predicted if the patient is pre-diabetic, diabetic, or non-diabetic/healthy by considering multiple factors such as blood sugar, cholesterol, daily routine, etc to ease the process of blood tests and medication process and can further be optimized and used at a larger scale.
